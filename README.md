# Bright Blackout

This GTK Theme is a inspired on the Materia Blackout theme from: https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1381066/. I used Themix GUI theme designer (https://github.com/themix-project/oomox) to build this project. I found Bright Mlackout unique in sense of being the unique that does not uses HiDPI configuration, which makes it does not distort too much some buttons on some GTK applications. This theme is meant to be used on with Tilling Window Manager, like DWM, i3 and so on, but it's good enough for beeing used on Full Desktop Environments.
